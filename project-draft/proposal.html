        <h2 class="styling">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of PC parts to choose from, with unintuitive names. Many parts also have variations between
            size/brand, which have differences that people might not understand. People have to dig deeper to find out
            which parts are actually better than others, and which parts are worth the price. There are cases where
            people might buy a PC or PC parts assuming that the price tag equates to its power, only to find out that it
            can’t handle what they wanted it to. On top of that, especially during the pandemic, the PC part market
            prices have skyrocketed, and scalpers (people who buy a lot of in-demand items and sell them at a higher
            price) have been able to take advantage of people desperate to build a PC. With PC gaming becoming more and
            more popular, there are undoubtedly too many people overpaying for their machine, whether they were too
            trusting of a scalper, a parent buying the most expensive PC possible because they didn’t know any better,
            or many other scenarios. There are many powerful websites, such as <a
                href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a>, which allows you to pick out parts based on tons
            of different filters, as well as the Reddit thread, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/">
                r/buildapcsales</a>. However, some people don't have time to put into researching what the difference
            between all these parts is, making sure compatible parts are bought together, and most importantly, the
            price to performance ratio. After all, just because a part is on sale doesn't mean you should buy it. Even
            in case someone is willing to buy a pre-built computer, we want to make sure they can at least learn about
            what they're getting. Basically, there is currently no place where all of
            this information is easily
            accessible to a beginner, and we want to fix that.</p>

        <h2 class="styling">Proposed App</h2>
        <p>Our users are a large population that share a passion for gaming. We will be considering those that are in
            the market to buy PC equipment (such as GPU and CPUs) who want to have the best cost efficient gaming
            experience. As consumers of computer parts and gaming peripherals, we want to know what and when
            to buy in order to build a suitable PC. This app will combine all of these necessities and organize the
            information into one platform. These are a few of the things that will be offered:
        <ul>
            <li><strong class="listed">Inputting Deals:</strong> Users can input the details of deals on games or PC parts, including seller, price,
                discount based on MSRP, and more!</li>
            <li><strong class="listed">Price History:</strong> Users can open up a graph of previously submitted prices on games or parts throughout the
                years, being able to see if there are predictable patterns on discounts!</li>
            <li><strong class="listed">Price To Performance:</strong> For PC parts, users will easily be able to look up the price to performance ratio
                for each part, mostly being processing power.</li>
            <li><strong class="listed">Recommended Specs:</strong> Users will be able to input a specific game or genre of games and quickly be given a
                complete PC build. If wanted, users can tweak the build with simple buttons (an up arrow to have the
                next most powerful part, for example).</li>
            <li><strong class="listed">PC Profile:</strong> Users can log in and keep track of their specs as a checklist of parts they need or are
                waiting for. This page will also have links to the intended buyer</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="styling">Use Cases</h2>
        <section>
            <p>So, let's say a parent uses the site. They have no prior knowledge of computers or PC parts whatsoever,
                and their child wants a PC to play Minecraft. The parent would be able do a quick search for Minecraft,
                and instantly receive an entire PC build based on the game's recommended specifications. The parent
                could then click on the down arrow button on the CPU for a weaker version to save money, however, a
                yellow exclamation mark warns them that the CPU is now below recommended specs. After clicking the down
                arrow again, the page now shows a red exclamation mark warning the user that the CPU is now below the
                minimum specs, and will not be able to run the game. On the other hand, if the parent wants to have a
                stronger computer, clicking the up arrow gives them a stronger part. Other quality-of-life features
                suited for beginners can also be added, maybe including a warning for bottlenecking (where a CPU is too
                weak and limits the full capacity of the GPU, or vice versa), or hovering over a part to see what other
                parts are compatible (Ryzen 3000 series CPUs are only compatible with B450, X470, and X570 motherboards,
                for example).

            <p>In the case of someone with more knowledge of PC parts, they can be providing information on deals for
                games and PC parts as they find them. When they want to input, a form opens up with options for seller,
                price, and discount percentage. The values inputted here will be keywords that appear in other user's
                searches. If they are trying to <em>find</em> a deal instead, they can search for specific products and
                check their price history, as submitted by users previously. This way, a graph with previous prices can
                be viewed, and the user can then try to find any trends in deals.</p>
